            </figure>
            <p>Skogafoss is a waterfall in the south of Iceland at the cliffs of the former coastline. After the coastline had receded seaward (it is now at a distance of about 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) from Skogar village), the former sea cliffs remained. Skogafoss is unique because the waterfall comes directly from two glaciers, Eyjafjallajokull and Myrdalsjokull.</p>

            <p>The Icelandic landscape is one of variety and contrast, offering incredible vistas. There are
                glaciers and volcanoes, waterfalls and fjords, hot springs and lava fields. From the rugged cliffs of the
                Westfj√∂rds to the black sand deserts of the Highlands, this combination of landscape features is definitely
                one of a kind.
