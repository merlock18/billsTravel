            <p>With over 250 glaciers, Iceland's famed ice caps draw the crowds. You can enjoy various activities,
                including hiking across glaciers, exploring ice caves, snowmobiling atop volcanoes covered in ice,
                kayaking in glacial lagoons with icebergs, and boat tours. You can also visit the non-icy products of
                Iceland's glaciers, including its river canyons carved out by the receding ice long ago.

        <p> Iceland is home to nearly 270 named glaciers, which cover over 10% of its landmass. These glaciers come in
            all shapes, sizes, and forms, including ice caps, outlet glaciers, alpine, mountain, cirque, and more.
            Iceland is even home to Europe's largest glacier, Vatnaj√∂kull, which connects to many other outlet glaciers
            on the South Coast. Learn what all these types of glaciers are, how they helped form the country throughout
            the millennia, and how they're connected to Iceland's volcanic activity.

            Although beautiful to simply look at, you can explore Iceland's glaciers in unique ways, with snowmobiles
            and hikes, through ice caves and iceberg lagoons, and via kayaks and boat tours. The most popular and
            accessible glaciers are along the southern stretch of the famous Ring Road, but you can find these ice caps
            in all regions of Iceland. Other popular glaciers are in the Golden Circle and Northern Iceland.
