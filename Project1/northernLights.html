        <p> The extreme dark of the Icelandic winter has a few perks. Between September and April, people in Iceland are
            treated to a magnificent natural display: the phenomenon of aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the
            Northern Lights.

            The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek word for the north
            wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show.

            Iceland is one of the best places in the world to experience the Northern Lights.

            The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights, is a natural phenomenon created when
            solar wind particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field. This excites the particles that release
            energy, causing peculiar luminous green and purple streaks across the skies.

            On clear winter nights, sightseeing trips are organized around this spectacular—though fickle—natural
            phenomenon. The ideal location for sightings varies and excursion leaders are skilled in "hunting" the
            lights, finding locations where conditions are best for seeing them on any given night.
